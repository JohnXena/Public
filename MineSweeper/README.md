Source code and assets can be downloaded and ran if you have the dependencies (python 3.10.5 or above and pygame 2.1.2 or above) installed.
If not, download the zip file, unzip into a folder and run the exe.
Make sure the assets folder is in the same directory as the .py/.exe or else will not work.
